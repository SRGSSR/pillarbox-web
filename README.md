# Pillarbox Web Player

[![Pillarbox logo](docs/README-images/logo.jpg)](https://github.com/SRGSSR/pillarbox-web)

## About

The Pillarbox Web Player is a web-based video player that extends Video.js to enable playback of
SRGSSR content through a custom data provider. This player is designed to enhance the viewing
experience of SRGSSR content, making it more accessible and feature-rich.

## Quick Start

To get started with Pillarbox, install it along with `video.js` using the following command:

```bash
npm install --save @srgssr/pillarbox-web video.js@8.21.0
```

> [!NOTE]
> `video.js` is now a peer dependency and must be installed by the project that bundles Pillarbox.
> Version 8.21.0 is the version we use to test the player and is the one we recommend.
> 
> This approach is more flexible and consistent with the fact that integrators are responsible for 
> providing their own UI components.

In your HTML file, add the following code to initialize Pillarbox:

```html
<video-js id="my-player" class="pillarbox-js" controls></video-js>
```

Import the CSS file in your HTML to apply Pillarbox default theme:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/@srgssr/pillarbox-web/dist/pillarbox.min.css"/>
```

Finally, import Pillarbox and set up the player:

```javascript
import pillarbox from '@srgssr/pillarbox-web';

const player = pillarbox('my-player', {/* options... */ });
player.src({ src: 'urn:swi:video:48115940', type: 'srgssr/urn' });
```

## CDN Integration

Pillarbox is an open-source project published as a public NPM package. You can easily include it in
your website using a public CDN that proxies NPM packagesâ€”such as [jsDelivr][js-deliver].

To integrate Pillarbox Web via CDN, you can include it in your HTML like this:

```html
<!-- It's recommended to specify an exact version in production.
     For example: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@srgssr/pillarbox-web@{version}/dist/pillarbox.umd.min.js
     In this example, we use the latest version for simplicity. -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@srgssr/pillarbox-web/dist/pillarbox.umd.min.js"></script>
<!-- Load additional plugins or extensions after Pillarbox -->
<script>
  // Example usage:
  const player = pillarbox('my-player', {/* options... */ });
  player.src({ src: 'urn:swi:video:48115940', type: 'srgssr/urn' });

  // Other classes and utilities available under `window.srgssr`:
  // DataProvider, MediaComposition, PillarboxMonitoring, Player, SRGAnalytics, SrgSsr
</script>
```

You can also use a different CDN or host the file yourself.

> [!NOTE]
> When using the UMD build via CDN, video.js is already bundled with Pillarbox.
> You should not include it separately.
> The UMD bundle also exposes `video.js` as a global variable, allowing you to use both and internal
> extensions as needed.

## Documentation

the [API Documentation](https://web.pillarbox.ch/api).

A live demo of the player is available
here: [Pillarbox Web Demo](https://demo.pillarbox.ch).

To expand the features that Pillarbox offers out of the box, visit the [Pillarbox Web
Suite](https://github.com/SRGSSR/pillarbox-web-suite). You are welcome to contribute and share your
own components there.

You can create your own theme with
the [Pillarbox Theme Editor](https://editor.pillarbox.ch).

## Pillarbox flavours

Pillarbox comes in two variants:

- `pillarbox-core`: is the core library that provides a rich set of features on top of the Video.js
  API. It does not include any SRGSSR-specific business logic, so it can be used by any developer
  who wants to customize their own video player.
- `pillarbox` is the complete package that includes the core library as well as the SRGSSR data
  provider and analytics. It is designed for SRGSSR applications that need to integrate with the
  SRGSSR media platform and tracking behavior.

## TypeScript Support

TypeScript is a language that extends JavaScript with static types and other features. It helps to
write more reliable and maintainable code. `Pillarbox` is written in plain JavaScript, but it
provides type declarations for TypeScript users. These declarations are carefully generated and
included in the bundled package.
